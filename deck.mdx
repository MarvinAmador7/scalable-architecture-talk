# Predictability
<Appear>
  <li>Functional Programing </li>
  <li>Immutable </li>
  <li>Naming conventions</li>
</Appear>

```notes
  Functional:
  that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
  It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements.
  First-class and higher-order functions
  Pure functions
  Recursion
  Strict versus non-strict evaluation
  Type systems
  Referential transparency

  Immutable:
  Immutable objects are simpler to construct, test, and use
  Truly immutable objects are always thread-safe
  They help to avoid temporal coupling (Básicamente consiste en tener un método que requiere de la ejecución de un segundo método antes de poder ser ejecutado.)
  Their usage is side-effect free
  immutable objects are thread-safe. This means that multiple threads can access the same object at the same time, without clashing with another thread.

  Naming conventions:
  To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code;[1]
  To enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards.
  To enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.

# Immutable data structures
- Persistent data structures
    - Structural sharing

```notes
In computing, a persistent data structure is a data structure that always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified. Such data structures are effectively immutable, as their operations do not (visibly) update the structure in-place, but instead always yield a new updated structure.

# Immutable data structures
### Tries

</a>

```notes
  Trie is a special kind of a tree data structure.
  This is different from a binary tree since no nodes specifically stores the key associated with that node. The node’s position in the tree defines the key it’s associated with
  Tries are commonly used to store dictionaries

# Scalability

# Reusablility
<Appear>
<li>Opportunistic</li>
<li>Planned</li>
</Appear>

```notes
  Opportunistic - While getting ready to begin a project, the team realizes that there are existing components that they can reuse.

  Planned – A team strategically designs components so that they'll be reusable in future projects.
